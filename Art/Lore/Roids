Roids is a tall and muscular fighter and is one of the four bosses in The Far Short.
Their focus is on teaching the player to be agressive in attacks, put pressure on the enemy and to be careful with when to use support moves.
Roids is a burning star of self-hatred, a star that's brilliance and light illuminates and amazes Purgatory far and wide. 
He does not speak, lest he hear his own voice. 
When the crowd roars and adrenaline takes control of every nerve, 
he for a moment is adrift in that silent sea, floating gently above cool waves of oblivion. 
Your body and blood are not yours, but instead Roids' tool to once more return to those waves, if only for a moment
