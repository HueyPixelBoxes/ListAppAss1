Trigger Fingers is one of the four possible bosses in The Far Shore.
Due to the signature ability Headshot, he can be quite fearsome, but Formless allows for an easy workaround. 
His focus is on teaching the player to hold back on some enemies and be more thoughtful as to when you attack.
Trigger Fingers, as Bosch has nicknamed him, arrived in Purgatory only moments ago. 
He is still in a suicidal haze of confusion, likely unaware that he has crossed over at all.
His firearm is the thin barrier between him and the starving jaws of Purgatory. 
As soon as he fires his final bullet, he is revealed for what he has always been -
a pathetic whelp suckling from the tit of an ideology he never meant anything to.
