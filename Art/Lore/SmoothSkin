The SmoothSkin is a pathetic, Lamia-like creature and is one of the three bosses of The Orpheum. 
It repeatedly summons Visages for support and slowly builds up Shield to defend itself.
Poor Smoothskin. The nameless race of lamia did not inhabit the Orpheum for long, driven out quickly by the "human" occupants of the Tunnel City. 
Smoothskin now is an inhabitant of the furthest reaches of the underground. 
His statues scare away any wandering soured sons that could prey upon him. 
Perhaps he has come to believe this safety is his family protecting him, even now.
