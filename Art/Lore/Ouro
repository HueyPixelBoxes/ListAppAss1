The Ouroboros is a large serpentine creature and is one of the three bosses of The Orpheum. 
It forced the player to be careful with their positioning and management of its Body and Tail.
The Ouroboros, fetched from the Maelstrom and brought to the Orpheum before the time of the Ungod by a now disbanded "Cult of Infinity Worshippers".
Many worshippers died in this transit. This "Infinity Cult" believed with ample sacrifices the Ouroboros would someday speak from its true, 
face and reveal mathematical and philosophical insights into the nature of Purgatory. 
Deprived of sacrifices, the Ouroboros now preys upon the fauna of the Orpheum trapped within its lagoon.
In times of starvation, it is known to feed upon itself. 
The Cult was disbanded suddenly and seemingly without cause. Perhaps in the end they got their wish?
