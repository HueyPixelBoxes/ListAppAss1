Mobius is one of the four possible bosses in The Far Shore. He is blue man standing on the corpse of a Mungodo and bears numerous spears.
He is a stationary boss that spawns with 2 special Mung on either side of him. He teaches the player how to deal with non-red pigment.
Mobius has seen all that Purgatory has to offer, his longevity a minor miracle of its own. 
He is old enough to have witnessed the arrival of the Ungod and in turn the collapse of the Tunnel City;
there is very little that could surprise Mobius anymore. He spends his days forever trying to find his way back to a love now lost. 
His mind has degraded and he has become utterly convinced that the gutting of Mung and Mungodo will lead to the return of his lost lover. 
Perhaps there is some method to his madness?
