The Charcarrion is a large, semi-humanoid creature and is one of the three bosses of The Orpheum.
It is an endurance fight that focuses on positioning and wearing away at your party's maximum health.
a hideous name for a being once heralded as the summit of beauty and honor. 
Before the time of humans there was another race, a race of scholarly giants which reveled in arts, sciences, and philosophies unknown. 
Purgatory was their world, they built cities and mounted a force strong enough to repel even an Ungod. 
Ultimately their mortal counterparts went extinct, and without reproduction within Purgatory, entropy began to claim them.
The Charcarrion, adorned in crowns of bronze, made a deal with a Demon for the strength to protect his kind as long as possible, 
in turn for his undying body becoming the Demon's new home. 
He reigned as the deathless king and fought the hand of entropy for what mortal minds would fathom as an eternity.
When the last of his kind turned to dust in his arms, rendered now but a barely-conscious worm, of bone, he knew he had failed,
but the pact with the Demon was forever. 
When you weep, weep for the beast now known as the Charcarrion, for he houses not a demon, but the kind of love only a Messiah could know.
