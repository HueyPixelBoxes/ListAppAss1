Heaven is a colossal wolf skull suspended by tendrils of oil from human hands of marble and is one of the two final bosses in the Garden.
A manifestation of the Garden you stand on
Heaven is a representation of mankind's fear of death, of what will happen after death, the "heaven" they so desire.
To face Heaven is to accept that there is no such thing as perfection or true satisfaction, embrace the flaws of themselves and be at peace in death
